# Modulus
A simple modulus calculator that works for arbitrary long numbers expressed as string.
it assumes the input is valid; otherwise, the behaviour is undefined.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository locally on your device:
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/giulianoassaggio/Modulus
	cd Modulus
	```
2. Then, compile code:
	```bash
	g++ -o modulus ./src/*.cpp
	```
3. Finally, run the program!
	```bash
	./modulus
	```
The program prompts you to input the number, base, and divisor. 
The number input is case-insensitive. 
Ensure you provide a valid input for the chosen base; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.
